# Physics-Lecture-Notes
Here are some of my notes of Physics courses for Grade 2-3 undergraduates, which mainly includes Classical Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Statistical Physics, Electrodynamics and Quantum Mechanics. You could refer to these notes while learning related courses. Physics Olympiad attendees are also welcome.

These notes are currently hand-taken. I will gradually substitute it with digitized ones when I have time.

Please inform me via my email xiaotianci@stu.pku.edu.cn if you have any problem with these notes, or in case you have noticed some mistakes in my notes.
